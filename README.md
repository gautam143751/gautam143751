# Gautam | Product Manager and 0-1 App Builder

I turn ambiguous problems into shipped products.

I work across product discovery, MVP definition, and hands-on implementation, with a strong focus on AI-powered workflows and developer tooling.

## Core Capabilities

- Product management: problem framing, user journey mapping, scope control, KPI definition
- 0-1 building: rapid prototyping, architecture decisions, iteration loops, launch readiness
- Self-starter execution: independently moves from idea to working system with docs, tests, and delivery artifacts

## How I Build (0-1 Playbook)

1. Define the user pain and success metric (speed, quality, cost, adoption)
2. Build a thin, testable MVP with clear interfaces
3. Instrument the workflow and collect real usage signals
4. Iterate on reliability, UX, and operational efficiency

## Selected Build Evidence

### 1) DocVQA CLI (Original)
Repository: [DocvQA](https://github.com/gautam143751/DocvQA)

- Product problem: extract structured information from document-heavy workflows consistently
- Product decisions:
  - CLI-first workflow for repeatable operations
  - provider abstraction (`llm` vs `document_ai`) to reduce vendor lock-in
  - storage abstraction (Firestore or local JSON) for production and offline testing
- Builder evidence:
  - modular architecture (`src`, `scripts`, `configs`, `docs`)
  - test suite (`tests/config`, `tests/data`, `tests/evaluation`, `tests/extractors`, `tests/pipeline`)
  - operational docs for dataset prep and configuration

## 2) git-ai (Fork + Active Contribution)
Repository: [git-ai](https://github.com/gautam143751/git-ai)

- Product problem: make AI-generated code provenance traceable in real teams
- Why this matters: strong signal for product thinking in AI governance and developer workflows
- Contribution model: active maintenance and merged updates in forked codebase

## 3) AI Agent Research Workflow (Imported/Adapted)
Repository: [DataAnalysis-LLM](https://github.com/gautam143751/DataAnalysis-LLM)

- Focus area: multi-agent workflow for analysis, visualization, and report generation
- Product lens applied: orchestration design, quality-review loop, and workflow clarity
- Attribution note: repository history contains significant upstream authorship; represented here as adaptation and product exploration, not greenfield ownership

## Product Operating Principles

- Start from user value, not feature volume
- Ship the smallest useful version quickly
- Prefer measurable outcomes over vague output
- Be explicit about trade-offs and ownership

## Current Focus

- AI-native product workflows
- Retrieval and document understanding systems
- Developer productivity tooling

## Collaboration

Open to roles and projects where I can own the path from idea to shipped product.

## Expected Profile Changes After This Import

- Clear positioning as a product manager who also builds
- Stronger 0-1 narrative tied to real repositories
- Higher credibility via explicit attribution for forked/imported work
- Better recruiter readability with outcome-oriented structure
- Improved profile conversion for PM + builder opportunities

## One-Go Profile Update Checklist

1. Replace `README.md` in `gautam143751/gautam143751` with this file.
2. Update profile pinned repositories to:
   - `DocvQA`
   - `git-ai`
   - `DataAnalysis-LLM` (only if attribution note is retained)
   - one additional original repo with the strongest hands-on ownership signal
3. Add real contact links in the `Collaboration` section.
4. Add 2 to 4 measurable outcomes to project sections (speed, accuracy, cost, adoption).
